Title: History cleansing for nonnegative integer-valued series with long runs of zeros
Description: An extension of the `tsclean` functionality in the `forecast` package.  
  The motivation for this package is a situation that arises frequently wih retail
  sales data, where a supply shortage can lead to several consecutive periods of zero sales 
  that should not affect the ongoing forecasts.  If demands are high these can be readily
  identified by standard algorithms, but, if demands are low, they can easily pass
  outlier checks.  We look at the lengths of runs of zeros as well as the frequency
  of zeros to identify this type of outlier.
